Running
=======

Once the application library has been installed and the configuration files are populated it can be started by
executing the following command line:

    .. parsed-literal::

        python -m irflowservice <configuration-directory>

    The ``<configuration-directory>`` argument must point to a directory containing the configuration files
    required for the application (see :doc:`configuration` ).

For example:

    .. parsed-literal::

        python -m irflowservice config
